# Integrating ShadowMap With Application Governance and Resilience Programs

This guide shows security and platform teams how to combine ShadowMap's reconnaissance data with
existing governance, data management, and reliability practices to expose unapproved applications,
untangle fragmented data flows, and surface silent system failures before they cascade into incidents.
It assumes you already run baseline ShadowMap scans and are ready to wire the results into your
operational tooling.

## 1. Establish a Unified Discovery and Ownership Baseline
1. **Inventory ingestion** – Export ShadowMap CSV or JSON outputs on a nightly cadence and ingest
   them into your configuration management database (CMDB) or asset graph alongside cloud tagging
   data. This merges ShadowMap discoveries with declared systems and flags "unknown" services.
2. **Ownership enrichment** – Cross-reference each discovered hostname or IP with product or
   application owners recorded in your ITSM platform. ShadowMap's metadata (headers, fingerprints,
   takeover signals) help teams confirm whether a service is sanctioned or requires investigation.
3. **Policy reconciliation** – Generate exception reports when ShadowMap finds assets without an
   assigned owner or policy tag. Route them through existing governance workflows so unapproved apps
   are captured, risk-ranked, and either registered or decommissioned.

## 2. Map and Monitor Data Flows
1. **Telemetry overlay** – Tag ShadowMap findings with data classification labels by matching DNS
   zones or subdomains to the systems that handle regulated data. This provides a quick view of
   where sensitive information might be processed outside official channels.
2. **Flow reconstruction** – Combine ShadowMap port and fingerprint data with network flow logs or
   service mesh telemetry to identify shadow integrations (e.g., unsanctioned APIs or storage
   endpoints). Document these flows in data lineage tools to eliminate fragmentation.
3. **Continuous validation** – Schedule ShadowMap scans after major releases or infrastructure
   changes, and compare deltas against approved data flow diagrams. Unexpected endpoints trigger a
   review to either document the new flow or remove it.

## 3. Detect Silent System Failures Early
1. **Heartbeat dashboards** – Feed ShadowMap's availability signals (HTTP status, TLS handshake
   success, open ports) into observability platforms alongside synthetic checks. Sudden drops in
   responsiveness signal silent outages in unattended services.
2. **Takeover and misconfiguration alarms** – Treat ShadowMap's takeover risk and CORS heuristics as
   high-signal monitors. Pipe alerts into incident management queues when previously healthy assets
   become takeover candidates or exhibit permissive cross-origin policies.
3. **Closed-loop remediation** – Link ShadowMap alert IDs to ticketing systems so remediation owners
   can acknowledge, resolve, and provide evidence. Use the feedback loop to retrain heuristics and
   reduce false negatives.

## 4. Operationalize the Feedback Loop
1. **Runbook updates** – Embed ShadowMap procedures into change management, onboarding, and incident
   runbooks so new teams know how to interpret and respond to findings about unapproved apps or
   abnormal flows.
2. **Metrics and reporting** – Track key performance indicators such as unresolved shadow assets,
   time-to-closure on policy exceptions, and frequency of silent failure detections. Present these in
   executive scorecards to demonstrate risk reduction.
3. **Evidence collection** – Store ShadowMap exports, alert histories, and remediation notes in your
   evidence repository. They satisfy SOC 2, ISO 27001, and GDPR documentation demands when auditors
   request proof of continuous monitoring.

By treating ShadowMap as the discovery front-end for governance, data lineage, and reliability
programs, teams gain a shared source of truth that continuously exposes gaps in application
registration, data handling, and operational health.
